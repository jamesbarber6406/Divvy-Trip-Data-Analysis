Trip data, from June 2013 to May 2024, was acquired from Divvy, a bicycle rideshare company located in Chicago. The data was cleaned and aggregated using RStudio. Visualization was performed using Tableau Public. The goal of the analysis was to determine how usage differs between annual members and casual riders. Two time lapses were constructed comparing the average ride length of each membership type according to the month or the day of the week. 

The ride length of members and casual riders appear to be fairly consistent each year. In Q2 of 2020, there is a slight increase in ride length of both member types, possibly due to the initial COVID lockdown. Ride length levels out later that year and stays consistent until 2022. From 2022 on, there is a gradual decrease in ride length for both member types. This could be due to recent inflation and the increase of pricing. However, this reason is purely speculative. 

The data required a lot of cleaning so that aggregation was possible. Column names and types were very inconsistent. On Divvy's website, it is stated that any bike not returned after 24 hours is considered stolen. However, there are many occurences in the data of rides significantly longer than 24 hours. There were also occurences of ride lengths having a negative value. As such, anything less than 0 minutes and greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours) were removed.
